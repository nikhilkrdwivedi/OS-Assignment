5.41 A barrier is a tool for synchronizing the activity of a number of threads.
When a thread reaches a barrier point, it cannot proceed until all other
threads have reached this point as well. When the last thread reaches
the barrier point, all threads are released and can resume concurrent
execution.
Assume that the barrier is initialized to N—the number of threads that
must wait at the barrier point:
init(N);
Each thread then performs some work until it reaches the barrier point:

/* do some work for awhile */
barrier point();
/* do some work for awhile */
Using synchronization tools described in this chapter, construct a barrier
that implements the following API:
• int init(int n)—Initializes the barrier to the specified size.
• int barrier point(void)—Identifies the barrier point. All
threads are released from the barrier when the last thread reaches
this point.
The return value of each function is used to identify error conditions.
Each function will return 0 under normal operation and will return
−1 if an error occurs. A testing harness is provided in the source code
download to test your implementation of the barrier.
